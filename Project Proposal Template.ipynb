    "- **Question 5:** Which equipment (goggles, gloves, gowns, etc.) helps most? (all the stuff except masks and ventilators) \n",
    "- **Question 6:** What kind of donor do we have/who donates the most? (private organization, government organizations, etc.)\n",
    "- **Question 7:** Is there a difference in the dispersion pattern of N95 masks when compared to regular masks? Did the case rates see a greater improvment?\n",
    "- **Question 8:** Are locations where tests are more commonly donated subject to a lower spread of disease?\n",
    "- **Question 9:** Does the dollar amount of donations affect the case rates/death rates in between certain countries?\n",
    "- **Question 10:** Does the number of ventilators donated affect death rates in any given country?\n",
    "- **Question 11:** Are certain types of donors are associated with more significant improvements in COVID - 19 case/death rates in the recipient countries?"
